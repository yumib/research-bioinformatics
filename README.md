In collaboration with Dr. Ayati at UTRGV, our work revolves around the exciting field of bioinformatics. Specifically, we are using the R programming language for our research. Our main focus is to investigate protein modification processes and their roles in various physiological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and cancer.

To guide our research, we have been referring to a research paper, which provides valuable insights into the protein modification process known as phosphorylation. This modification is crucial in understanding its impact on physiological diseases and cellular signaling pathways.

Our specific task is to deepen our understanding by exploring the potential connections between phosphorylation and another protein modification process called O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation is known to have a similar function and importance to phosphorylation, but its interplay and implications in physiological diseases remain less explored.

To achieve this goal, we employ various bioinformatics techniques and data analysis approaches in R. Firstly, we calculate correlations between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation data, exploring potential associations between these two modifications. This involves comparing the levels of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation across various proteins to identify any patterns or trends.

Next, we engage in the normalization of data to ensure that we are making meaningful comparisons across different samples and experimental conditions. Normalization is essential to remove potential biases and variations, allowing us to draw more accurate conclusions from our analysis.

As we progress, we generate insightful visualizations in the form of graphs to help us better understand the associations between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. These graphs provide a clear representation of the data and enable us to identify any potential trends or relationships.

Overall, our collaborative work with Dr. Ayati involves bridging the knowledge gap between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation, shedding light on their joint impact on physiological diseases. By employing various computational methods in R and leveraging the research paper's guidance, we hope to contribute valuable insights to the field of bioinformatics and unravel the intricate interplay of these protein modification processes in disease pathways.
